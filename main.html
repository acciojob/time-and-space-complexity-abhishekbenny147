	<h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
	<p>Optimizing an algorithm often involves balancing Time complexity to ensure that it remains efficient even as the input size grows</p>
	<p>To achieve efficient space usage, aim to design algorithms with <b>Space Complexity</b> of O(n), where n represents the size of the input data</p>
